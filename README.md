# Deep-Learning-and-ML-Basics
This repository contains the basics of deep learning and data analysis files that I have been working on. 
I mostly made use of libraries like numPy, Pandas, matplotlib, seaborn and tensorflow(only the basics).

# Platform used
All the code available in this repository have been coded and executed in Google Colab. Colab is a hosted Jupyter Notebook service that requires no setup to use and provides free access to computing resources, including GPUs and TPUs. Colab is especially well suited to machine learning, data science, and education.

# Why tensorflow
The main reason for using tensorflow is that the tutorials and courses I referred and practiced to learn ML basics used tensorflow. I also found a huge support base for tensorflow on sites like stack overflow. 
But I did find trouble in switching between different versions.
